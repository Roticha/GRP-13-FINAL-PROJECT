    " ## 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Introduction \n",
    "In an era where public opinion on products can shape brand perception, companies increasingly rely on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for real-time customer feedback analysis. This project, applies NLP techniques to classify Twitter sentiment related to Apple and Google products, addressing a real-world need for understanding public sentiment in a rapidly evolving market. By using sentiment polarity classification,it provides actionable insights into customer satisfaction and emerging issues, enabling companies, marketing teams, and decision-makers to make data-driven decisions. These insights help brands like Apple and Google improve products, refine customer support strategies, and optimize marketing efforts based on social media sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "The problem is to accurately classify the sentiment of tweets related to Apple and Google products. We want to determine whether a tweet expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This classification can help companies understand customer satisfaction, identify potential issues, and tailor their responses accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Stakeholders \n",
    "- The companies: Apple & Google- Considering these companies are direcly affected by the sentiment, it is important for them to gauge the perception of their products so as to identify the areas of improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Marketing teams- this sentiment analysis and model can help them respond to negative feedback, adjust their marketing campaigns and highlight the positive aspects of their products.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The customer support teams &decision makers- the sentiment analysis is important for they can use it to improve product development, customer support and brand reputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4  Business Value\n",
    "By accurately classifying tweets, our NLP model provides actionable insights to stakeholders. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifying negative sentiment can help companies address issues promptly.\n",
    "- Recognizing positive sentiment can guide marketing efforts and reinforce successful strategies.\n",
    "- Understanding neutral sentiment can provide context and balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Objectives \n",
    "Main Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop a NLP (Natural Language Processing) multiclass classification model for sentiment analysis, aim to achieve a recall score of 80% and an accuracy of 80%. The model should categorize sentiments into three classes: Positive, Negative, and Neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- To idenitfy the most common words used in the dataset using Word cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To confirm the most common words that are positively and negatively tagged.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To recognize the products that have been opined by the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To spot the distribution of the sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6 Conclusion \n",
    "Our NLP model will contribute valuable insights to the real-world problem of understanding Twitter sentiment about Apple and Google products. Stakeholders can leverage this information to enhance their decision-making processes and improve overall customer satisfaction."
