    " ## 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Introduction \n",
    "In an era where public opinion on products can shape brand perception, companies increasingly rely on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for real-time customer feedback analysis. This project, applies NLP techniques to classify Twitter sentiment related to Apple and Google products, addressing a real-world need for understanding public sentiment in a rapidly evolving market. By using sentiment polarity classification,it provides actionable insights into customer satisfaction and emerging issues, enabling companies, marketing teams, and decision-makers to make data-driven decisions. These insights help brands like Apple and Google improve products, refine customer support strategies, and optimize marketing efforts based on social media sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "The problem is to accurately classify the sentiment of tweets related to Apple and Google products. We want to determine whether a tweet expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This classification can help companies understand customer satisfaction, identify potential issues, and tailor their responses accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Stakeholders \n",
    "- *The companies*: Apple & Google- Considering these companies are direcly affected by the sentiment, it is important for them to gauge the perception of their products so as to identify the areas of improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Marketing teams*- this sentiment analysis and model can help them respond to negative feedback, adjust their marketing campaigns and highlight the positive aspects of their products.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *The customer support teams &decision makers*- the sentiment analysis is important for they can use it to improve product development, customer support and brand reputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4  Business Value\n",
    "By accurately classifying tweets, our NLP model provides actionable insights to stakeholders. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifying negative sentiment can help companies address issues promptly.\n",
    "- Recognizing positive sentiment can guide marketing efforts and reinforce successful strategies.\n",
    "- Understanding neutral sentiment can provide context and balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Objectives \n",
    "Main Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop a NLP (Natural Language Processing) multiclass classification model for sentiment analysis, aim to achieve a recall score of *80%* and an accuracy of *80%*. The model should categorize sentiments into three classes: *Positive*, *Negative*, and *Neutral*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- To idenitfy the most common words used in the dataset using Word cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To confirm the most common words that are positively and negatively tagged.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To recognize the products that have been opined by the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To spot the distribution of the sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6 Conclusion \n",
    "Our NLP model will contribute valuable insights to the real-world problem of understanding Twitter sentiment about Apple and Google products. Stakeholders can leverage this information to enhance their decision-making processes and improve overall customer satisfaction."

    "## 2. Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Data source\n",
    "The dataset originates from CrowdFlower via data.world. Contributors evaluated tweets related to various brands and products. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each tweet was labeled as expressing *positive*, *negative*, *no emotion* or *can't tell* toward a brand or product.\n",
    "- If emotion was expressed, contributors specified which brand or product was the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Suitability of the Data\n",
    "Here's why this dataset is suitable for our project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Relevance*: The data directly aligns with our business problem of understanding Twitter sentiment for Apple and Google products.\n",
    "- *Real-World Context*: The tweets represent actual user opinions, making the problem relevant in practice.\n",
    "- *Multiclass Labels*: We can build both binary (positive/negative) and multiclass (positive/negative/neutral) classifiers using this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Dataset Size\n",
    "The dataset contains over 9,000 labeled tweets. We'll explore its features to gain insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "- *tweet_text*: The content of each tweet.\n",
    "- *is_there_an_emotion_directed_at_a_brand_or_product*: No emotion toward brand or product, Positive emotion, Negative emotion, I can't tell\n",
    "- *emotion_in_tweet_is_directed_at*: The brand or product mentioned in the tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 Feature Selection\n",
    "Tweet text is the primary feature. The emotion label and target brand/product are essential for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.6 Data Limitations\n",
    "- *Label Noise*: Human raters' subjectivity may introduce noise.\n",
    "- *Imbalanced Classes*: We'll address class imbalance during modeling.\n",
    "- *Contextual Challenges*: Tweets are often short and context-dependent.\n",
    "- *Incomplete & Missing Data*: Could affect the overall performance of the models."
